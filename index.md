# Observatree

```
We must open the dome and turn the wheel
And watch the stars with untiring zeal.
We must toil at night though cold it be
And never should expect a decent salaree.
```

<sub><sup>*</sup>Since [Jonathan McDowell](https://planet4589.org/jcm/index.html) has emended the pronouns, perhaps it is reasonable for [me](http://observatree.github.io/brianhill) to do so too.</sub>
